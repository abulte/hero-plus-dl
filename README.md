# hero-plus-dl

Download (free!) your videos from GoPro Hero Plus service.

This is quite unpolished but it did the job for a one time thing.

You'll need to tell Firefox to download the file and remember the option the first time it pops up.

:warning: Don't kill the browser until everyting is downloaded.

```shell
GP_USER=gopro_user GP_PASSWORD=gopro_password python cli.py download
```

After downloading your files, you can move them into `YYYY-MM-DD` folders with:

```shell
python cli.py date-tree {path-where-your-videos-are}
```

## Known issues

- Does not handle media library pagination (100 max I guess, I only had 88 at the time) ; should be easy to add if needed (and can be tested)
- Does not handle pictures (Firefox does not download them by default)

## Why

- Select multiples files and download is _flawed_ on Hero Plus, it will "forget" some videos :facepalm:
- You have to pay yearly to host your photos on Hero Plus and getting them out is difficult ATM
- Sync from camera to Hero Plus is awfully slow
- Hero Plus interface is bug-ridden and slow IMHO
- â€”> I'd rather host and manipulate them on my own software stack
